# Changelog

All notable changes to MeetingBot are documented here.

Format: `## [version] - YYYY-MM-DD` followed by categorised bullet points.

> **Latest version:** 2.5.2 — **Last updated:** 2026-03-20

---

## [2.5.2] - 2026-03-20

### Fixed
- **Landing page**: Renamed misleading `--dark` CSS variables to semantic `--bg`, `--bg-alt`, `--bg-muted` names — all resolve to white/light gray, eliminating any confusion about theme
- **Dashboard analytics consolidated**: Replaced bare 4-KPI section + external `/api-dashboard` links with 3 tabbed sub-sections (Overview, API Usage, Trends) that load data inline via existing REST endpoints
- **Removed external link fragmentation**: No more links to separate `/api-dashboard` page — all analytics data is now accessible within the dashboard's own Analytics tab

### Changed
- **Dashboard Analytics → Overview tab**: Monthly bots, integrations, calendar feeds, API keys + recent bot performance table (server-rendered)
- **Dashboard Analytics → API Usage tab**: Bots 7d/30d, tokens, cost, error rate, platform breakdown, tokens by operation (lazy-loaded from `/api/v1/analytics/api-usage`)
- **Dashboard Analytics → Trends tab**: Monthly meetings, AI cost, action items, avg duration, sentiment trend, cost by platform (lazy-loaded from `/api/v1/analytics/me`)

---

## [2.5.1] - 2026-03-20

### Changed
- **Analytics reorganized with tabbed sub-navigation** — All analytics data consolidated into 5 clear tabs: Overview, AI & Costs, Errors & Health, Features, Users
- **Admin Overview slimmed** — Removed duplicated Platform Features card and Bot Breakdown (same data now lives in Analytics tabs)
- **System Status moved** — Runtime metrics (running tasks, queue depth) relocated from Analytics to the System tab where they belong
- **Chart.js resize fix** — Charts properly resize when switching between hidden/visible tabs

---

## [2.5.0] - 2026-03-20

### Changed

  - **base.html** — New CSS variables, frosted glass navbar (white + backdrop blur), mobile hamburger menu, softer shadows and borders
  - **landing.html** — Converted from full dark (#0a0f1e) to clean white/light gray with subtle indigo accents
  - **login.html & register.html** — Dark left panels replaced with soft indigo gradient, dark text
  - **admin.html** — Dark navy sidebar converted to white with light borders and indigo active states
  - **dashboard.html** — Sidebar polish, horizontal scrollable pill nav on mobile, sticky positioning
  - **webhook_playground.html & api_dashboard.html** — Light navbar and background
- **Mobile responsiveness** — Added hamburger menu to all pages, horizontal scrollable sidebar on mobile, proper sticky positioning, tablet breakpoints
- **Design system** — Updated color palette: softer borders (#e5e7eb), subtle shadows, 14px body text, rounded corners (14px cards)

---

## [2.4.0] - 2026-03-20

### Added
- **Comprehensive admin analytics** — Expanded `/admin#analytics` with 6 new visualization sections:
  - **Status & Plan distribution** — Horizontal bar chart of bot statuses + doughnut of plan tiers
  - **Revenue & Billing** — 30-day daily revenue line chart + credit flow breakdown (added/consumed/net by type)
  - **Error analysis** — Errors by platform bar chart + top 10 error messages table
  - **Webhook health** — Delivery success rate, status breakdown, recent failures list
  - **Action items** — Total/open/done counts with completion rate progress bar
  - **Template & transcription** — Template usage table + Gemini vs Whisper doughnut
  - **System status** — Running tasks, queue depth, max concurrent, in-memory bots
- **Expanded KPI grid** — 13 cards (was 8): added Bots (7d), Avg Duration, Error Rate, Revenue (30d), and more
- **Backend analytics API extended** — `platform_analytics()` now returns billing, webhook, action item, error, and system data

---

## [2.3.1] - 2026-03-20

### Fixed
- **RBAC fails closed** — Workspace role check now returns 500 on DB errors instead of silently allowing access
- **Exception details no longer leaked** — Webhook delivery list endpoints return generic error, log details server-side
- **Calendar feed SSRF protection** — iCal URLs validated against private/reserved IPs (reuses webhook `_block_ssrf`)
- **Webhook state race condition** — Per-webhook locking prevents concurrent `dispatch_event` calls from corrupting `consecutive_failures` / `is_active`
- **Action item sub-user isolation** — New `sub_user_id` column + filtering so sub-users only see their own action items
- **Live transcript flush resilience** — Failed flush retries on next entry instead of losing the timestamp
- **SSE push error handling** — Fire-and-forget tasks wrapped in safe handler to prevent silent "Task exception never retrieved" warnings

### Changed
- **Bot queue** — Uses `collections.deque` (O(1) popleft) instead of `list.pop(0)` (O(n))
- **URL parsing** — Recurring meeting intelligence parses meeting URL once instead of 4 times
- **Screenshot pruning** — Runs at session start in addition to session end
- **VERSION file** — Fixed sync (was `2.2.0`, now matches actual version)
- **Pre-commit hook** — `.githooks/pre-commit` warns if VERSION/README/CHANGELOG are stale
- **CLAUDE.md** — Added mandatory pre-commit checklist for version and date updates

---

## [2.3.0] - 2026-03-19

### Added
- **Async dashboard — zero page reloads** — All 10 dashboard actions (API key create/revoke, webhook register, integration add/toggle/delete, calendar feed add/toggle/delete) now use `fetch()` + in-place DOM updates with toast notifications. No full-page reload occurs for any dashboard action.
- **`apiFetch()` helper** — Shared JS utility in `base.html` for all dashboard mutations. Automatically attaches `Content-Type: application/json` and `Accept: application/json` headers; throws on non-2xx responses with the server's `detail` message.
- **Browser back button support** — `switchSection()` now uses `window.history.pushState()` (not `replaceState`). A `popstate` listener restores the correct section when the user presses Back — the browser history stack works fully within the dashboard.
- **Schedule Bot in-place update** — After scheduling a bot, a `<tr>` is inserted into the bots table immediately without calling `window.location.reload()`.
- **Admin endpoint rate limiting** — `PUT /api/v1/admin/wallet`, `PUT /api/v1/admin/rpc-url`, and `POST /api/v1/admin/credit` are now limited to **10 requests/minute per IP**. `POST /api/v1/admin/usdc/rescan` is limited to **5/minute**. Returns HTTP 429 when exceeded.
- **Webhook replay protection** — Signed webhook deliveries now include an `X-MeetingBot-Timestamp` header alongside `X-MeetingBot-Signature`. The HMAC is computed over `{timestamp}.{body}` instead of just `{body}`. Recipients should reject deliveries where `abs(now - timestamp) > 300 seconds`.

### Changed
- **Webhook HMAC format (BREAKING)** — The signed payload is now `f"{timestamp}.{body}"`. Update your HMAC verification to extract `X-MeetingBot-Timestamp`, prepend it to the body, and verify the combined string. The 5-minute replay window is enforced server-side on delivery; recipients are responsible for enforcing it client-side.
- **Bot queue latency: 10 s → near-zero** — The queue processor previously polled every 10 seconds with `asyncio.sleep(10)`. It now wakes immediately via `asyncio.Event` when a bot is enqueued. Slots are filled in under 100 ms.
- **Analytics response caching** — `GET /api/v1/analytics` results are cached for **30 seconds** per account. `GET /api/v1/analytics/api-usage` results are cached for **60 seconds**. Reduces `list_bots()` calls under high-frequency polling.

### Fixed
- **WebSocket DB error now fails explicitly** — Previously, a database error during token lookup would return `None`, which was indistinguishable from an unknown/invalid token. Now returns close code **4503 (Service Temporarily Unavailable)** with reason `"Service temporarily unavailable"` so clients can distinguish a transient DB failure from a bad token.
- **Calendar feed dedup memory leak** — The `_dispatched` set grew unbounded across long-running instances. Changed to a `dict[key, float]` with a 48-hour TTL. A prune sweep runs every 288 poll cycles (~24 h at default 5-minute intervals). Memory is now bounded.
- **Dashboard JSON response branches** — All 10 `POST /dashboard/*` handlers now return `JSONResponse` when the request includes `Accept: application/json`, enabling the new async fetch flow. The redirect-based form flow is preserved for non-JS clients.

---

## [2.2.0] - 2026-03-17

### Added
- **Split API documentation** — public Swagger UI at `/api/docs` exposes only user-facing endpoints (admin-only routes, platform analytics, and `ai_usage` cost fields are hidden). Full schema including all admin endpoints and AI cost data is available at `/api/v1/admin/docs` (admin accounts only)
- **`/bot/{id}` session viewer** — new web UI page showing transcript, AI analysis (summary, key points, action items, decisions, next steps, sentiment, topics), speaker breakdown, chapters, meeting metadata, and download links for audio/video/markdown/PDF
- **`GET /api/v1/templates/default-prompt`** — returns the raw default analysis prompt so callers can inspect or extend it before passing `prompt_override`
- **`GET /api/v1/search`** — full-text search across all transcripts in memory; query param `q` returns matching snippets with bot context
- **Modern landing page** — public marketing homepage at `/` replacing the previous redirect; shows features, quick-start examples, and sign-up CTA. Authenticated users are auto-redirected to `/dashboard`
- **Dashboard redesign** — full account management in the dashboard: API key copy-to-clipboard, integrations (Slack/Notion) add/pause/delete, calendar feed add/pause/remove, notification preferences, and recent bots overview — all without leaving the page

### Fixed
- **Startup hang fix** — asyncpg now uses a 10 s connection timeout; `create_all_tables()`, `load_persisted_bots()`, and `load_persisted_webhooks()` wrapped in `asyncio.wait_for()` so the server always becomes ready (and `/health` always responds) even when the database is temporarily unavailable at boot
- **DB startup retry** — `create_all_tables()` is retried up to 5 times with a 5 s delay between attempts (handles Railway where the PostgreSQL container starts in parallel with the app container)
- **PostgreSQL migration compatibility** — schema migration `ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS` now uses a `try/except` guard compatible with older asyncpg/PostgreSQL versions

## [2.2.0] - 2026-03-16

### Added
- **Business accounts** — new `account_type` field (`personal` or `business`) for platforms integrating MeetingBot on behalf of multiple end-users. Business accounts use a single API key and credit balance but can completely isolate data between end-users via the `X-Sub-User` header
- **Sub-user data isolation** — pass `X-Sub-User: <user-id>` header (or `sub_user_id` in bot creation body) to scope all bot data to a specific end-user. Users cannot see each other's bots, transcripts, or analyses. Omit the header for an account-wide view
- **Copy-to-clipboard for API keys** — clipboard icon beside each API key in the dashboard, with visual feedback on copy. Newly created keys show the full key once with a prominent copy button
- Account type selection on the registration page (Personal / Business)
- Business account info card on the dashboard with integration examples
- Account type column in the admin panel's user accounts table
- `sub_user_id` field in bot creation, bot response, and bot summary schemas

### Changed
- `POST /api/v1/auth/register` now accepts `account_type` field (`personal` | `business`)
- `GET /api/v1/auth/me` now returns `account_type` in the response
- All bot endpoints (`GET`, `DELETE`, transcript, recording, analyze, ask, highlight, follow-up email) now respect `X-Sub-User` header for data isolation
- Bot list and stats endpoints filter by `sub_user_id` when the header is present

---

## [2.1.0] - 2026-03-16

### Added
- **Admin interface** — platform administration panel at `/admin` (web UI) and `/api/v1/admin/*` (API), restricted to admin accounts only
- **Platform USDC collection wallet** — admins can set/change a single Ethereum wallet address where all users send USDC via `PUT /api/v1/admin/wallet` or the admin web UI
- **User wallet registration** — users register their Ethereum wallet on their account (`PUT /api/v1/auth/wallet`). The USDC monitor matches the `from` address of incoming transfers to the platform wallet against registered user wallets, automatically crediting the correct account
- **Admin API endpoints:** `GET /api/v1/admin/wallet`, `PUT /api/v1/admin/wallet`, `GET /api/v1/admin/config`
- **User wallet endpoints:** `GET /api/v1/auth/wallet`, `PUT /api/v1/auth/wallet`
- **Admin access control** — only `assad.dar@gmail.com` or accounts with `is_admin=true` can access admin endpoints and the `/admin` page; all others receive HTTP 403
- `is_admin` and `wallet_address` fields on Account model
- `PlatformConfig` database model for storing platform-level key/value settings
- Admin nav link (visible only to admin users) in the web UI navbar
- Wallet registration card on the user dashboard
- Wallet status shown on the top-up page with warnings if not registered

### Changed
- `GET /api/v1/billing/usdc/address` now returns the admin-configured platform wallet when set (with the user's registered wallet info), falling back to HD-derived per-user addresses
- USDC transfer monitor now supports two modes: platform wallet (matches `from` address to user wallets) and HD wallet (matches `to` address to per-user deposit addresses)
- Top-up page (`/topup`) shows the platform wallet when configured by an admin, with user wallet status
- `CRYPTO_HD_SEED` is no longer required for USDC deposits if a platform wallet is set via the admin panel
- `GET /api/v1/auth/me` now includes `wallet_address` in the response

---

## [1.5.1] - 2026-03-14

### Fixed
- Silent audio capture: disabled out-of-process audio service, corrected PulseAudio sink volume, fixed VAD streaming loop reliability
- Caption scraping failure and audio silence in Google Meet sessions
- VAD streaming loop now always runs when Gemini is available
- Removed blocking `socket.getaddrinfo()` DNS lookup from `WebhookCreate` Pydantic validator — the synchronous call was blocking the async event loop and raising "Network is unreachable" when DNS was unavailable (same fix previously applied to the bot URL validator)
- `POST /api/v1/bot` now returns HTTP 503 with a clear diagnostic message when the database is unreachable (e.g. misconfigured `DATABASE_URL` or Supabase credentials), instead of the opaque "Database error: [Errno 101] Network is unreachable"

---

## [1.4.0] - 2026-03-07

### Added
- **AI usage tracking** — every bot response now includes a full `ai_usage` breakdown: tokens, cost, provider, model, and per-operation timing
- **Stripe billing** — flat per-meeting fees, per-token usage billing, and a cost-markup multiplier; checkout and subscription endpoints added
- **Claude API integration** — `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` enables `claude-opus-4-6` for meeting analysis; takes precedence over Gemini when both keys are set
- `GET /api/v1/billing/usage` — aggregated AI usage across all meetings
- `GET /api/v1/billing/meeting/{bot_id}` — per-meeting charge breakdown
- `POST /api/v1/billing/checkout` — Stripe one-time payment checkout
- `POST /api/v1/billing/subscribe` — Stripe metered subscription checkout
- `POST /api/v1/billing/webhook` — Stripe webhook handler

### Changed
- Frontend served from the correct `FRONTEND_DIR` path
- All new billing and usage panels added to the web UI

---

## [1.3.0] - 2026-02-28

### Added
- **Third-party integrations** — Slack, Notion, Linear, Jira, HubSpot post-meeting push
- **PDF and Markdown export** — `GET /api/v1/bot/{id}/export/pdf` and `/export/markdown`
- **Speaker profiles** — auto-created after each meeting; cross-meeting stats (talk time, meeting count, questions asked); CRUD endpoints under `/api/v1/speakers`
- **Bot queue** — `MAX_CONCURRENT_BOTS` (default 3) limits simultaneous bots; extras queue and start automatically when a slot opens
- **AI tools** — follow-up email draft (`POST /api/v1/bot/{id}/followup-email`), pre-meeting brief (`POST /api/v1/bot/{id}/brief`), recurring meeting intelligence (`GET /api/v1/bot/{id}/recurring`)
- **Ask Anything** — `POST /api/v1/bot/{id}/ask` for free-form transcript Q&A
- **Share links** — unique `share_token` per bot; public read-only report at `GET /api/v1/share/{token}`
- **Recording download** — `GET /api/v1/bot/{id}/recording` to retrieve raw WAV audio
- Hardened security: SSRF DNS checks on webhook URLs and meeting URLs, LIKE-escape injection fix, parallel webhook broadcasts

### Fixed
- SQLite-incompatible pool args removed from async engine
- SMTP calls moved to thread pool to avoid event loop freeze
- DB indexes added for status, `created_at`, `meeting_url`, `share_token`

---

- **Voice mention responses** — `respond_on_mention`, `mention_response_mode` (`text` / `voice` / `both`), `tts_provider` (`edge` / `gemini`)
- **Microsoft Edge TTS** (`edge-tts`) — fast (~300 ms) voice replies with no extra API key
- **Gemini TTS** — more natural voice via `gemini-2.5-flash-preview-tts`
- **`start_muted`** — controls whether the bot joins with its microphone muted
- Bot join retry logic — `BOT_JOIN_MAX_RETRIES` and `BOT_JOIN_RETRY_DELAY_S`
